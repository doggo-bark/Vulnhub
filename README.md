# Vulnhub machines
 Hey there! This is a list of Vulnhub boxes that I have done, sorted by difficulty. Each box should be linked to a corresponding write-up. However, many are not linked to a write-up because, at the time of doing these, I only took personal notes. 
 
 The difficulty is relative. As a beginner, it can take a lot of time to finish only one easy box, and you might still not understand everything. Much later, finishing an intermediate or hard box can take less time than finishing an easy box did in the beginning.
 
 Therefore, you could say that easy boxes are actually pretty damn hard if you are a beginner. Later, hard boxes are actually not that hard. It gets faster over time â€“ the first 20 labs will take longer than the last 40.
